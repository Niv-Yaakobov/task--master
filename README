To run the frontend part:
1. go to the terminal and go to the frontend directory.
2. write in the terminal "npm start"

To fix the IP:
because the PC is using wifi its IP can be change, so before running the program check if the .env 
file in the frontend is updated (the IP address is correct, using the command ipconfig.exe in the cmd).
